## General Info
Mock online ordering system for Boba tea shops. Inspired by news outlet report of restaurants not having a reliable online ordering system during the Covid-19 lockdown aka "shelter-in-place" order throughout California, I wanted to create this to learn and continue growing as a software developer. Modern day issues can be resolved by modern technology! #beatcovid
