## General Info
In the recent days after Bay Area, California was issued the 'shelter-in-place' order, a lot of independently owned tea shops are struggling to stay afloat. Further more, a good percentage of them do not have a reliable online ordering system. For the love of boba, I want this project to be free as much as possible to my clients affected by Covid-19. Take care everybody!

## Concept
* Ability to create online store
* Accept Online payments with Paypal, Square, Venmo, Stripe
* Ability to add product item with image upload + description
* Product Customizations (Less sugar, more sugar, less ice etc.)
* SMS notification when order is ready
* Map displaying all available boba shops
* Display nearest available boba shops closest to user

## Technologyes (Pending)
* Node.js | Flask/Django
* MongoDB | MySQL
